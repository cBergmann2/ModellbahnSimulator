/*
Two interrupt examples are provided -

+ Method 1 does everything in C code.
+ Method 2 uses an assembly file wrapper.

Code size:
Method 1 uses assembly macros to save and restore the task context, whereas
method 2 uses functions. This means method 1 will be faster, but method 2 will
use less code space.

Simplicity:
Method 1 is very simplistic, whereas method 2 is more elaborate. This
elaboration results in the code space saving, but also requires a slightly more
complex procedure to define interrupt service routines.

Interrupt efficiency:
Method 1 uses the compiler generated function prologue and epilogue code to save
and restore the necessary registers within an interrupt service routine (other
than the RTOS tick ISR). Should a context switch be required from within the ISR
the entire processor context is saved. This can result in some registers being saved
twice - once by the compiler generated code, and then again by the FreeRTOS code.
Method 2 saves and restores all the processor registers within each interrupt service
routine, whether or not a context switch actually occurs. This means no registers
ever get saved twice, but imposes an overhead on the occasions that no context switch
occurs.
